     title: "ChatGPT's new 'Browse with Bing': Watching AIs stalk you is odd",
     date: "June 6, 2024",
     initialContent: "This week, I logged into ChatGPT to continue testing its ChatGPT plugins feature, only to notice a new addition to the beta feature section: Browse with Bing. Needless to say, I jumped on it — who doesn’t love a new toy? — and put it through its paces. However, not only was I amazed by how powerful this new feature is, I was a little unsettled by how it could be used as well.",
     mainTitle : "Browse with Bing is ChatGPT's answer to Google Bard",
     mainContent : "AI Competition IntensifiesThe introduction of Bing integration into ChatGPT marks a significant moment in the ongoing AI battle between Google and OpenAI. Previously, one of Bard's most touted features was its access to real-time information, which gave it an edge in answering questions about current events, technology trends, or even recent pop culture shifts. With ChatGPT now powered by Bing, that advantage has been neutralized. This update allows ChatGPT to deliver timely, relevant information while retaining its unique conversational capabilities, which are often praised for being more context-aware and human-like than Bard's more straightforward responses.Bridging the Information Ga Since its launch, ChatGPT had operated within a bubble of knowledge that stopped in 2021. While this made it a great tool for historical information, general knowledge, and technical guidance, it struggled to provide up-to-date responses on current events, news, or recent innovations. This gap in information could cause frustration among users seeking advice or insights on fast-evolving topics like cryptocurrency, AI advancements, or even sports. With Bing now integrated, this gap is closed. Users can ask ChatGPT about the latest tech launches, global news, and market trends with confidence.A Game Changer for Everyday Use For everyday users, the ability to browse the web is a game changer. Before the Bing integration, ChatGPT's primary function was more educational or task-oriented: generating essays, solving problems, or explaining concepts. Now, it can help with far more practical, real-world scenarios, such as finding the best travel deals, comparing products, checking local weather, or even helping users shop online. It turns ChatGPT into a true assistant for daily life, not just a tool for abstract queries.Plugins as the X-Factor Another huge advantage that ChatGPT has over Bard is the introduction of Plugins. These Plugins allow users to interact with a wide variety of services directly from the chat interface. Want to order food, book a flight, or even send a tweet? ChatGPT, thanks to its Plugin capabilities, can do that. This feature further distinguishes ChatGPT, allowing for much deeper integration with real-world tasks. While Google Bard remains focused on providing answers, ChatGPT is rapidly transforming into an all-in-one assistant that can not only give you information but also help you take action.The Future of AI-Assisted SearchThe AI landscape is evolving quickly, and with the introduction of Bing browsing into ChatGPT, OpenAI has set the stage for a new kind of search experience—one that is more conversational and adaptive. Unlike traditional search engines that list a bunch of links, ChatGPT (powered by Bing) will synthesize data into coherent, user-friendly answers, eliminating the need for users to sift through multiple pages. While Google Bard remains a strong competitor, Google now faces the challenge of catching up in areas where ChatGPT has leapfrogged ahead.Conclusion: What Lies Ahead for Bard and ChatGPTAs AI search tools continue to develop, the competition between Google Bard and ChatGPT will likely result in more features and improvements for both platforms. Google's Bard may have started with an advantage in real-time data, but ChatGPT has now erased that lead and gone further by adding capabilities like Plugins and third-party integrations. It will be interesting to see how Bard responds to these innovations and what new developments are on the horizon for both systems."

    title: "4 user story templates + how to write them with examples",
    date: "April 24, 2024",
    initialContent: "For software devs, it's easy to focus on what you're making and forget who you're building software for. While the Agile methodology stresses the importance of feature requirements, the end user should be top of mind throughout the entire software development process. Thankfully, you can frame these requirements in a short, simple description. We call these templates a user story.Creating user stories helps devs understand the problems they’re solving for users and how to make their tasks easier. With simple, non-technical language, you can establish the value behind a piece of software. Not only will this help teams understand what they're making, but also why it matters. ",
    mainTitle : "What is a user story?",
    mainContent : "A user story describes product features from the end user's perspective. Product managers and designers write these brief stories to convey why users need or want certain functionality. Within the range of Agile team practices, user stories are the smallest unit of work, so they are intended to be specific.Three elements go into creating user stories, known as the three Cs: The card: This is the physical place where you write a user story. Placing the story on a physical card helps cement for team members the criteria and user problem it's solving. The conversation: User stories inspire team discussions on how to meet the user requirements. Your team can brainstorm new solutions by asking questions and reaching a shared understanding. The confirmation: Product managers and designers need to lay out acceptance criteria that meet user requirements. Once your team wants to proceed with a solution, devs move forward with this confirmation. Note: Some teams add a fourth “C” for “context” on more complex stories.Standard user story template User stories consist of one or two sentences. In that space, they describe end users who earn value through your product. The user story format reads: As a [user], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]Let's explore that format in more detail:As a [user]: Explain who you're building this product for. Go beyond job titles and cliches, and capture the user's inner sense of value. If your organization uses buyer personas, you can apply a specific one here.  I want to [goal]: Describe the user’s intentions rather than how they get there. The goal matters more than implementation.So that [benefit]: Break down how meeting a goal benefits the user. Remember to look at the bigger picture or a deeper desire in users. Bear in mind that teams can use other user story formats. Some popular options include: In order to [receive benefit] as a [role], I can [goal/desire].As [who] [when] [where], I [want] because [why].Types of user storie Depending on the complexity of your user stories, they may fit into different categories. Sometimes, you can even combine user stories into a larger narrative. Below are the four main types of user stories: Simple: These are individual or self-contained user stories that focus on a particular user or type of product. Epic: Groups of related user stories come together to form epics. They may involve multiple users working together or independently or multiple needs for a single type of user to achieve some goal or benefit. Thematic: These are major investments and strategies that group epics together. Thematic user stories highlight how a company will achieve wider goals. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe): These user stories add extra details such as a benefit hypothesis, cost of delay, or nonfunctional requirements."
