     title: "ChatGPT's new 'Browse with Bing': Watching AIs stalk you is odd",
     date: "June 6, 2024",
     initialContent: "This week, I logged into ChatGPT to continue testing its ChatGPT plugins feature, only to notice a new addition to the beta feature section: Browse with Bing. Needless to say, I jumped on it — who doesn’t love a new toy? — and put it through its paces. However, not only was I amazed by how powerful this new feature is, I was a little unsettled by how it could be used as well.",
     mainTitle : "Browse with Bing is ChatGPT's answer to Google Bard",
     mainContent : "AI Competition IntensifiesThe introduction of Bing integration into ChatGPT marks a significant moment in the ongoing AI battle between Google and OpenAI. Previously, one of Bard's most touted features was its access to real-time information, which gave it an edge in answering questions about current events, technology trends, or even recent pop culture shifts. With ChatGPT now powered by Bing, that advantage has been neutralized. This update allows ChatGPT to deliver timely, relevant information while retaining its unique conversational capabilities, which are often praised for being more context-aware and human-like than Bard's more straightforward responses.Bridging the Information Ga Since its launch, ChatGPT had operated within a bubble of knowledge that stopped in 2021. While this made it a great tool for historical information, general knowledge, and technical guidance, it struggled to provide up-to-date responses on current events, news, or recent innovations. This gap in information could cause frustration among users seeking advice or insights on fast-evolving topics like cryptocurrency, AI advancements, or even sports. With Bing now integrated, this gap is closed. Users can ask ChatGPT about the latest tech launches, global news, and market trends with confidence.A Game Changer for Everyday Use For everyday users, the ability to browse the web is a game changer. Before the Bing integration, ChatGPT's primary function was more educational or task-oriented: generating essays, solving problems, or explaining concepts. Now, it can help with far more practical, real-world scenarios, such as finding the best travel deals, comparing products, checking local weather, or even helping users shop online. It turns ChatGPT into a true assistant for daily life, not just a tool for abstract queries.Plugins as the X-Factor Another huge advantage that ChatGPT has over Bard is the introduction of Plugins. These Plugins allow users to interact with a wide variety of services directly from the chat interface. Want to order food, book a flight, or even send a tweet? ChatGPT, thanks to its Plugin capabilities, can do that. This feature further distinguishes ChatGPT, allowing for much deeper integration with real-world tasks. While Google Bard remains focused on providing answers, ChatGPT is rapidly transforming into an all-in-one assistant that can not only give you information but also help you take action.The Future of AI-Assisted SearchThe AI landscape is evolving quickly, and with the introduction of Bing browsing into ChatGPT, OpenAI has set the stage for a new kind of search experience—one that is more conversational and adaptive. Unlike traditional search engines that list a bunch of links, ChatGPT (powered by Bing) will synthesize data into coherent, user-friendly answers, eliminating the need for users to sift through multiple pages. While Google Bard remains a strong competitor, Google now faces the challenge of catching up in areas where ChatGPT has leapfrogged ahead.Conclusion: What Lies Ahead for Bard and ChatGPTAs AI search tools continue to develop, the competition between Google Bard and ChatGPT will likely result in more features and improvements for both platforms. Google's Bard may have started with an advantage in real-time data, but ChatGPT has now erased that lead and gone further by adding capabilities like Plugins and third-party integrations. It will be interesting to see how Bard responds to these innovations and what new developments are on the horizon for both systems."

    title: "4 user story templates + how to write them with examples",
    date: "April 24, 2024",
    initialContent: "For software devs, it's easy to focus on what you're making and forget who you're building software for. While the Agile methodology stresses the importance of feature requirements, the end user should be top of mind throughout the entire software development process. Thankfully, you can frame these requirements in a short, simple description. We call these templates a user story.Creating user stories helps devs understand the problems they’re solving for users and how to make their tasks easier. With simple, non-technical language, you can establish the value behind a piece of software. Not only will this help teams understand what they're making, but also why it matters. ",
    mainTitle : "What is a user story?",
    mainContent : "A user story describes product features from the end user's perspective. Product managers and designers write these brief stories to convey why users need or want certain functionality. Within the range of Agile team practices, user stories are the smallest unit of work, so they are intended to be specific.Three elements go into creating user stories, known as the three Cs: The card: This is the physical place where you write a user story. Placing the story on a physical card helps cement for team members the criteria and user problem it's solving. The conversation: User stories inspire team discussions on how to meet the user requirements. Your team can brainstorm new solutions by asking questions and reaching a shared understanding. The confirmation: Product managers and designers need to lay out acceptance criteria that meet user requirements. Once your team wants to proceed with a solution, devs move forward with this confirmation. Note: Some teams add a fourth “C” for “context” on more complex stories.Standard user story template User stories consist of one or two sentences. In that space, they describe end users who earn value through your product. The user story format reads: As a [user], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]Let's explore that format in more detail:As a [user]: Explain who you're building this product for. Go beyond job titles and cliches, and capture the user's inner sense of value. If your organization uses buyer personas, you can apply a specific one here.  I want to [goal]: Describe the user’s intentions rather than how they get there. The goal matters more than implementation.So that [benefit]: Break down how meeting a goal benefits the user. Remember to look at the bigger picture or a deeper desire in users. Bear in mind that teams can use other user story formats. Some popular options include: In order to [receive benefit] as a [role], I can [goal/desire].As [who] [when] [where], I [want] because [why].Types of user storie Depending on the complexity of your user stories, they may fit into different categories. Sometimes, you can even combine user stories into a larger narrative. Below are the four main types of user stories: Simple: These are individual or self-contained user stories that focus on a particular user or type of product. Epic: Groups of related user stories come together to form epics. They may involve multiple users working together or independently or multiple needs for a single type of user to achieve some goal or benefit. Thematic: These are major investments and strategies that group epics together. Thematic user stories highlight how a company will achieve wider goals. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe): These user stories add extra details such as a benefit hypothesis, cost of delay, or nonfunctional requirements."

    title: "Scrum vs. SAFe: Which Agile framework is right for your team?",
    date: "June 05, 2023",
    initialContent: "Agile project management has made waves through software development circles. Much of Agile’s appeal lies in its flexibility. Thanks to its range of strategies, you can pick an Agile framework suited to your unique needs or strengths. With this in mind, many organizations choose between the Scrum vs. SAFe approach. While both frameworks are popular, they can reshape your organization in different ways. So, when deciding between Scrum vs. SAFe, you have to consider your resources and goals. To help you pick the best framework, we’ll describe both approaches, their similarities and differences, and the kind of teams they’re best suited for ",
    mainTitle : "What is Scrum?",
    mainContent : "Scrum is an Agile framework in which small, self-organized teams deliver high-quality software quickly. Scrum development values simplicity, creating adaptable teams that make deliveries based on stakeholder input. To make this work, Scrum devs break large projects into small steps. By building cross-functional teams, Scrum empowers devs to address multiple issues and project types. Its small team structure also maintains productivity and cost-effectiveness as requirements change. Smaller teams also ensure every dev knows who to talk to about specific issues. This streamlined setup fosters collaboration and lets team members review their work more thoroughly.Scrum development relies on three key roles:Product Owners align a Scrum team’s goals with customer and stakeholder expectations. They can also provide feedback or insight on product requirements. Scrum Masters oversee a Scrum team and Scrum processes. They remove dev obstacles, keeping team members productive and on task.Scrum teams work with the above two roles to complete the goals outlined in each sprint planning phase. They’re the boots-on-the-ground employees who build a product.Pros and cons of Scrum To better understand Scrum, here are its main advantages and drawbacks. Pros:Optimized dev processes Emphasis on the end user’s wants Fast delivery times Easy coordination within small teams Cons: Difficult to scale to larger project Requires teamwide training Dev cycles may not always align with project deadlines who is Scrum best for? Scrum complements small organizations and independent teams. In particular, you should use Scrum if your devs run up against:Frequent input from stakeholders and customers Changing deliverables teams must adapt to Short turnaround times before delivering high-quality product What is SAFe? The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) helps organizations set objectives and meet customer demands. Whereas Scrum relies on narrow focus and small teams, SAFe is more comprehensive. It coordinates multiple groups and leaders to deliver products too large or complex for Scrum. SAFe exchanges Scrum’s flexibility for a more rigid structure. While it offers continuous development, SAFe sets objectives that vary by team. However, these different groups complement one another and work toward the same end goals. To manage this organization, SAFe incorporates three core tenets: Lean Product Development reduces waste and optimizes processes. This cost-effective approach maintains productivity during continuous development. Agile Software Development involves incremental changes made on the fly. This iterative approach accounts for feedback and new demands. While less flexible than Scrum, SAFe still makes room for fast adaptations in development.System Thinking is a dev approach that builds solutions holistically. When designing a product, teams would incorporate all aspects of the system. This approach highlights how all parts of a system relate and fit into larger systems."

      title: "What is R&D capitalization?",
      date: "March 17, 2024",
      initialContent: "R&D capitalization refers to the accounting practice of treating research and development (R&D) expenditures as capital investments rather than immediate expenses. This approach allows companies to recognize the costs associated with R&D activities as assets on their balance sheets instead of expensing them in the current period. By capitalizing R&D costs, companies can spread the expense over the useful life of the developed product, which can lead to higher reported profits in the short term. This treatment can enhance a company's perceived financial health and attractiveness to investors. Under certain accounting frameworks, such as IFRS and GAAP, companies may capitalize R&D costs when specific criteria are met, such as when the project is expected to provide future economic benefits. Capitalizing R&D costs reflects the belief that these expenditures contribute to long-term value creation, similar to investments in property, plant, and equipment. To qualify for capitalization, R&D projects usually need to demonstrate technical feasibility, intent to complete the project, and the ability to use or sell the resulting product. This practice increases a company's asset base, improving key financial ratios, such as return on assets (ROA), while leading to lower expense recognition in the income statement during the initial years, potentially distorting financial performance metrics. Once capitalized, R&D costs are typically amortized over the expected useful life of the resulting product or technology, allowing for gradual expense recognition. Overall, R&D capitalization significantly influences how a company's innovation activities are reflected in its financial statements, affecting stakeholders' perceptions and decision-making processes.R&D capitalization is a crucial aspect of financial reporting that allows companies to manage their research and development expenditures effectively. By capitalizing these costs, businesses can improve their financial performance metrics, as the immediate impact on profitability is reduced. This practice can lead to a more favorable view of a company's financial health, especially in industries where R&D is a significant component of the business model, such as pharmaceuticals, technology, and manufacturing.The decision to capitalize R&D expenses involves careful consideration of accounting standards, as different jurisdictions may have varying guidelines regarding what can be capitalized. For instance, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) allow for the capitalization of R&D costs once a project reaches a certain stage of development, such as when it is technically feasible and there is intent and ability to complete it. In contrast, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States typically require that all R&D costs be expensed as incurred, with some exceptions for software development costs.Capitalized R&D is treated as an intangible asset on the balance sheet, and this treatment can significantly affect a company’s overall valuation. Investors and analysts often look at the level of capitalized R&D in relation to a company's total assets as an indicator of its commitment to innovation and growth potential. Additionally, the amortization of capitalized R&D over the life of the asset allows for a more gradual recognition of expenses, which can stabilize earnings and reduce volatility in financial results."
